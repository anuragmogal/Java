This is the directory for the Assignment 5: Shape

This folder contains 9 java files out of which 8 are classes and one is interface:

Shape.java
Volume.java
Circle.java
Rectangle.java
Square.java
Sphere.java
Cylinder.java
Pyramid.java
Main.java
Shape.java contains three functions:

stateShape(): Non-abstract method which print out which is shape class is using this class.
calculateArea(): Abstract method for area calculation that needs to be overridden where the class in extended
calculatePerimeter(): Abstract method for perimeter calculation that needs to be overridden where the class in extended
Volume.java contains one function:

calculateVolume(): Abstract method that needs to be overridden where the class in implemented
Circle.java contains two functions:

Circle(): Constructor of Circle class to take in radius of circle
calculateArea(): Calculating area of the circle overriding the abstract method from Shape class
calculatePerimeter(): Calculating perimeter of the circle overriding the abstract method from Shape class
Rectangle.java contains three functions:

Rectangle(): Constructor for Rectangle class to take in length and breadth of rectangle
calculateArea(): Calculating area of the rectangle overriding the abstract method from Shape class
calculatePerimeter(): Calculating perimeter of the rectangle overriding the abstract method from Shape class
Square.java contains three functions:

Square(): Constructor for Square class to take in side of the square
calculateArea(): Calculating area of the square overriding the abstract method from Shape class
calculatePerimeter(): Calculating perimeter of the square overriding the abstract method from Shape class
